        <strong>Senior Product Designer - AMC Networks</strong>
        <em>November 2018 to Present</em>
        <description>At AMC Networks I worked as an embedded designer on product and engineering teams, designing and prototyping features and experiences for mobile, web, and TV devices, and as an end to end designer and frontend developer creating consumer facing experiences with internal marketing teams. I managed a small team of developers and set up internal processes for request intake, project tracking, and quality assurance for our amcplus.com marketing site. I advocated for and was a primary contributor to the first design system at AMCN, which now powers a suite of 40+ applications.</description>

        <strong>Design Lead - Storybook Labs</strong>
        <em>January 2016 - September 2017</em>
        <description>I worked with Storybook Labs from the initial pitch to bring the product to life. I built the prototype that helped secure an initial round of funding and cement first place in the pitch competition where I met the team. Once funded, I worked with engineers leading end-to-end design of features on iOS.</description>

        <strong>Chief of Everything - James Garrett Co (Freelance)</strong>
        <em>April 2013 to Present</em>
        <description>Freelancing taught me how to solve problems, how to turn an idea into a shippable digital product, how to work with constraints, and how to improvise. Some of my favorite projects have included building a winning campaign website for US Congressman Charlie Rangel, working with One World Observatory on their launch, and building API-driven art installations with MacArthur ‘Genius Grant’ recipient Sarah Sze at the Copenhagen Contemporary Museum of Art.</description>
